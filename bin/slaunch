slaunch - Submit a job to process multiple subjects.

Usage: slaunch [command options] commands subjects [launch options]

Construct a command for multiple subjects and submit a job to
run the commands in parallel.

In the commands string, any '{}' will be replaced with
subject identifier. Use the -t option to see the commands without
actually submitting a job.

Example:
slaunch -t "convert_dicom.py {}" bender_01:bender_01a

Uses the -t (test) option to display all commands that would
be run. Note the command must be placed in quotes.

slaunch "convert_dicom.py {}" bender_01:bender_01a -N 1 -n 2 -r 00:30:00

runs 'convert_dicom.py bender_01' and 'convert_dicom.py bender_01a'
in parallel and saves output to the current directory.

Example:
export SUBJIDFORMAT=bender_%02d # zero-padded two-digit number
export BATCHDIR=\$WORK/batch
slaunch -g "convert_dicom.py {}" 1:2:3:4 -N 1 -n 4 -r 00:30:00

runs 'convert_dicom.py bender_01', 'convert_dicom.py bender_02',"
'convert_dicom.py bender_03', and 'convert_dicom.py bender_04'
in parallel on one node, and writes logs to \$WORK/batch.
Subject IDs are created from the subject numbers based on the
SUBJIDFORMAT variable, using printf.

Command options:
-t
    Test; just display all commands that would be run.

-J
    Job name. Information about the job will be saved in
    \$BATCHDIR/\${jobname}XX.{sh,slurm,out}, where XX is a
    serial number. Default is 'Job'.

-f file
    Test for a file dependency. Any {} is replaced with the
    subject, and that subject is only run if the file exists.

-n file
    Test for an output that does not exist. Any {} is replaced
    with the subject, and that subject only runs if the file
    does not exist.

-g
    Generate subject IDs based on subject numbers. Must set the
    SUBJIDFORMAT environment variable. printf will be used to
    generate subject IDs based on the input numbers, based on
    SUBJIDFORMAT.

Launch options:
Run 'launch -h' to see all job submission options.
